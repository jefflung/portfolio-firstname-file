# portfolio-firstname-file
1.	Create a new file and name it Firstname_File
2.	Using python codes, 
(a) create a text file and name it firstName.txt
(b) write ten different first names to firstName.txt
(c) read contents from firstName.txt

Summary:
A text file is created and it is written with a number of first names which are
separated in an individual line. Then, the text file is opened and content is printed.

Self-reflection:
Initially, I missed the line 15 which performs the open file function so the text content
could not be printed.
